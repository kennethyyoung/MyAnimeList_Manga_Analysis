    "## 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "**Objective**: The anime industry is a multi-billion dollar market heavily reliant on adapting existing source material (Manga, Light Novels). However, only a small fraction of published works receive adaptations. This project aims to build a machine learning classification model to identify the statistical profile of manga that sustain a multimedia franchise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge (Data Causality)**: We are analyzing a static dataset (collected in 2023). This introduces a \"Causality Dilemma\":\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Ideal Scenario**: We would use historical data to predict its adaptation in a later year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Actual Scenario**: We only have current metrics. A manga's current popularity (members) is often inflated because it received an anime adaptation (Reverse Causality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Strategy**: To mitigate this \"Post-Adaptation Bias,\" we will engineer features that focus on intrinsic properties (Density, Ratios) rather than raw totals. We define the problem not as \"Forecasting,\" but as \"Franchise Characterization\": Can we distinguish the signal of a commercially viable property from the noise of the general market, even with the presence of retrospective bias?"

    "**Source**: The dataset is a snapshot of MyAnimeList.net (MAL), the world's largest active anime and manga community. It was scraped using the Jikan API and hosted on Kaggle by Andreu Vall Hernàndez.\n",
    "\n",
    "**URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreuvallhernndez/myanimelist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Composition**: The analysis utilizes two distinct files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `manga.csv` **(The Features)**: Contains ~67,000 entries of source material, including metadata (Authors, Genres), status (Publishing/Finished), and community metrics (Score, Members).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.    `anime.csv` **(The Reference)**: Contains ~24,000 entries of animated works. This file is used primarily as a \"Lookup Table\" to determine if a manga has been adapted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope of Analysis**: We restrict our analysis to Mainstream Original Source Material. To ensure we are modeling commercial viability for the general market, we filter out:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    *Doujinshi* (Fan-made comics)\n",
    "\n",
    "*    *Manhwa/Manhua* (Korean/Chinese comics, unless explicitly adapted)\n",
    "\n",
    "*    *One-shots* (Single chapters)\n",
    "\n",
    "*    *Adult Content* (Hentai/Erotica): These works operate in a distinct market with different production incentives and are excluded from this analysis."
